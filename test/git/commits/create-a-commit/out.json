This is a timestamp in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. |\n\nYou can also provide an optional string `signature` parameter. This value will be added to the `gpgsig` header of the created commit. For a commit signature to be verifiable by Git or GitHub, it must be an ASCII-armored detached PGP signature over the string commit as it would be written to the object database.\n\n**Note**: To pass a `signature` parameter, you need to first manually create a valid PGP signature, which can be complicated. You may find it easier to [use the command line](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) to create signed commits.\n\nIn this example, the payload that the signature is over would have been:\n\n"
