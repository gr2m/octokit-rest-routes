  "description": "If you need a small number of personal access tokens, implementing the [web flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-authorization-options-for-oauth-apps/) can be cumbersome. Instead, tokens can be created using the OAuth Authorizations API using [Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth#basic-authentication). To create personal access tokens for a particular OAuth application, you must provide its client ID and secret, found on the OAuth application settings page, linked from your [OAuth applications listing on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers).\n\nIf your OAuth application intends to create multiple tokens for one user, use `fingerprint` to differentiate between them.\n\nYou can also create OAuth tokens through the web UI via the [personal access tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Read more about these tokens on the [GitHub Help site](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).\n\nOrganizations that enforce SAML SSO require personal access tokens to be whitelisted. Read more about whitelisting tokens on the [GitHub Help site](https://help.github.com/articles/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).",
