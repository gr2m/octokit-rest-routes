  "description": "Both `:base` and `:head` must be branch names in `:repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `:repo`, use the format `<USERNAME>:branch`. For example:\n\n```\nGET /repos/:owner/:repo/compare/hubot:branchname...octocat:branchname\n```\n\nThe response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in reverse chronological order.\n\nPass the appropriate [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.\n\n**Working with large comparisons**\n\nThe response will include a comparison of up to 250 commits. If you are working with a larger commit range, you can use the [Commit List API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits-on-a-repository) to enumerate all commits in the range.\n\nFor comparisons with extremely large diffs, you may receive an error response indicating that the diff took too long to generate. You can typically resolve this error by using a smaller commit range.",
