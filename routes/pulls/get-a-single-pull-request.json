  "description": "Each time the pull request receives new commits, GitHub creates a merge commit to _test_ whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base branch. (This _test_ commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch.)\n\nThe value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before a pull request is merged, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After a pull request is merged, the attribute changes depending on how the pull request was merged:\n\n*   If the pull request was merged as a merge commit, the attribute represents the SHA of the merge commit.\n*   If the pull request was merged via a squash, the attribute represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.\n*   If the pull request was rebased, the attribute represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.\n\nThe value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, this means that the mergeability hasn't been computed yet, and a background job was started to compute it. Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. When the job is complete, the response will include a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute.\n\nPass the appropriate [media type](/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.",
