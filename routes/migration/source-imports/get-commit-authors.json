  "description": "Each type of source control system represents authors in a different way. For example, a Git commit author has a display name and an email address, but a Subversion commit author just has a username. The GitHub Importer will make the author information valid, but the author might not be correct. For example, it will change the bare Subversion username `hubot` into something like `hubot <hubot@12341234-abab-fefe-8787-fedcba987654>`.\n\nThis API method and the \"Map a commit author\" method allow you to provide correct Git author information.",
