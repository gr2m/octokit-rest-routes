The user's [membership status](#get-organization-membership) will be `pending` until they accept the invitation.\n    \n*   Authenticated users can _update_ a user's membership by passing the `role` parameter. If the authenticated user changes a member's role to `admin`, the affected user will receive an email notifying them that they've been made an organization owner. If the authenticated user changes an owner's role to `member`, no email will be sent.\n\n**Rate limits**\n\nTo prevent abuse, the authenticated user is limited to 50 organization invitations per 24 hour period. If the organization is more than one month old or on a paid plan, the limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour period.",
