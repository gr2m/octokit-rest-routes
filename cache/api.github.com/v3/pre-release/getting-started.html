<p>In order to use any Pre-release program, you must accept the <a href="https://github.com/prerelease/agreement">pre-release agreement</a> for your user and/or organization. Once you&apos;ve accepted the agreement, you&apos;ll have access to our Platform Pre-release programs.</p>
<p>All Pre-releases are listed on the <a href="/early-access/platform-roadmap">GitHub Platform Roadmap</a>. You can check there to see when we expect a Pre-release to move to full general release.</p>
