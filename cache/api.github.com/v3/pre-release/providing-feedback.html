<p>We run the GitHub Platform Forum at <a href="https://platform.github.community">platform.github.community</a>. You&apos;ll be able to collaborate with other integrators, as well as engineers and product managers from GitHub. To foster transparency and collaboration, the GitHub Platform Forum should be used for all discussions, bug reports, and requests. If you need to discuss a private concern, you can contact <a href="https://github.com/contact">GitHub support</a> for assistance.</p>
