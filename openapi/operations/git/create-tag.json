  "description": "Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do this call to create the tag object, and then [create](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference) the `refs/tags/[tag]` reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.\n\n**Signature verification object**\n\nThe response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:\n\nThese are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:\n\n| Value                    | Description                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `expired_key`            | The key that made the signature is expired.                                                                                       |\n| `not_signing_key`        | The \"signing\" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature.                                           |\n| `gpgverify_error`        | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service.                                                         |\n| `gpgverify_unavailable`  | The signature verification service is currently unavailable.                                                                      |\n| `unsigned`               | The object does not include a signature.                                                                                          |\n| `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit.                                                                                      |\n| `no_user`                | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit.                                                          |\n| `unverified_email`       | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |\n| `bad_email`              | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature.             |\n| `unknown_key`            | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account.                                                  |\n| `malformed_signature`    | There was an error parsing the signature.                                                                                         |\n| `invalid`                | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature.                      |\n| `valid`                  | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified.                                                  |",
