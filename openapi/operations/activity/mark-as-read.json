If the number of notifications is too large to complete in one request, you will receive a `202 Accepted` status and GitHub will run an asynchronous process to mark notifications as \"read.\" To check whether any \"unread\" notifications remain, you can use the [List your notifications](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/notifications/#list-your-notifications) endpoint and pass the query parameter `all=false`.",
