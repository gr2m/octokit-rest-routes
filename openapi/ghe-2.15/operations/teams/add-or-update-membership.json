To add a membership between an organization member and a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a maintainer of the team.\n\nIf the user is unaffiliated with the team's organization, this endpoint will send an invitation to the user via email. This newly-created membership will be in the \"pending\" state until the user accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the \"active\" state and the user will be added as a member of the team. To add a membership between an unaffiliated user and a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner.\n\nIf the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a maintainer of the team.",
