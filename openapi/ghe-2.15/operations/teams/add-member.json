It allows you to invite new organization members to your teams.\n\nTo add someone to a team, the authenticated user must be a team maintainer in the team they're changing or be an owner of the organization that the team is associated with. The person being added to the team must be a member of the team's organization.\n\nNote that you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see \"[HTTP verbs](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.15/v3/#http-verbs).\"",
